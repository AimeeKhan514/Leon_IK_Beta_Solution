                        <p class="fs-3 text-dark-custom">How much will it cost?</p>
                        <p class="text-secondary mb-3">Cost is obviously a very important factor in product design. The
                            total cost of a new product will often be comprised of (i) R&D professional time costs, (ii)
                            Materials costs, and (iii) Tooling/Setup costs.</p>
                        <p class="text-secondary mb-3">How we price a job, depends on the nature/category of that
                            particular project. For instance:</p>
                        <ul class="ul text-secondary">

                            <li><strong>Simple projects</strong> contain <ins><em>no</em> variables/unknowns</ins>.
                                Hence, we will be able to issue a fixed price quote.</li>

                            <li><strong>Complicated projects</strong> contain <ins><em>some</em>
                                    variables/unknowns</ins>. While we may be able to provide you with a very general
                                cost estimate, in order to understand and eliminate these variables and unknowns we will
                                first need to undertake a Project Scope. We will then be in a better position to issue
                                you the expected costs for the full project. The cost of undertaking a Project Scope
                                will be agreed up-front.</li>

                            <li><strong>Complex projects</strong> contain <ins><em>many</em> variables/unknowns</ins>.
                                Therefore, it is not possible to provide the expected full costs of these projects until
                                later in the development. We would typically undertake these projects on an agile,
                                hour-rate basis, with an agreed up-front amount of hours per stage of work.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p class="fs-3 text-dark-custom">How long will it take?</p>
                        <p class="text-secondary mb-3">New product development often involves the exciting process of
                            creating never-before-developed entities - and each new product is unique. Some new products
                            can be developed in as little as a month or two - while others can take a years to fully
                            develop before they are ready to be commercialised.</p>

                        <p class="text-secondary mb-3">How we scope and plan the time involved to complete a job,
                            depends on the nature/category of that particular project. For instance:</p>
                        <ul class="ul text-secondary">

                            <li><strong>Simple projects</strong> contain <ins><em>no</em> variables/unknowns</ins>.
                                Therefore, we will be able to issue a reasonably certain delivery date in the quote.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Complicated projects</strong> contain <ins><em>some</em>
                                    variables/unknowns</ins>. Similarly as to arriving at a cost, we may be able to
                                provide a broad time estimate, but will need to undertake a formal Project Scoping
                                exercise, understanding and eliminating variables, in order to be in a better position
                                to issue you the expected time frames for the full project.</li>

                            <li><strong>Complex projects</strong> contain <ins><em>many</em> variables/unknowns</ins>.
                                Hence, it is not possible to provide the expected time frame to undertake the full
                                project until later in the development. We would typically undertake these projects on
                                an agile, iterative basis, with an up-front agreed amount of hours (a.k.a “chunk of
                                work”).</li>
